TURBO2 is a deep-learning outdoor 4WD rover using NVIDIA Jetson TX1/TX2 for autonomous navigation and motion control.  It uses Stereolabs [ZED](http://stereolabs.com) and LIDAR processed by neural networks with [reinforcement learning](http://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-reinforcement)) for pathfinding, obstacle avoidance, and performing vision-guided tasks with it's arm like manipulation and picking of objects.

All the materials and code for building the robot are released here on GitHub.  See the Bill of Materials in [BoM.md](./BoM.md)
